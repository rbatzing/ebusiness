Management studies focuses on the control, operation and development of a business. Financiers study how to use investments to maximize opportunities to grow the business.

# Essentials of Business Quality Management: (ISO9001)

Business communications are built around active communication chain. Teamwork and management requires effective communication. However, communication breaks down when the communication chain is interupted. 
  
A> ## Communication Chain
A>
A> ![Communication Chain](images/communication.png)
A>
A> | Initiation message | Response message |
A> |-----------|-----------|
A> | Greeting | Acknowledgement |
A> | Question | Response |

A> | Command | Action |
A> | Accusation | Acceptance/Rebuttal |

ISO 9000 was first published in 1987 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was designed as a family of quality management systems standards to help organizations manage the meeting of the needs of customers and while meeting statutory and regulatory requirements related to a product or service.[^iso]  The standards provide guidance and tools for companies and organizations who want to ensure that their products and services consistently meet customerâ€™s requirements, and that quality is consistently improved.

[^iso]: International Organization for Standardization, 2015. ISO 9001:2015(en) Quality management systems. Available online at  https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:9001

* **Point 1: Clear customer understanding** of the goods or services offered
* **Point 2: Verification of intended results** 
* **Point 3: Prevention undesired effects**
* **Point 4: Improve performance** based on the information gathered

A> ## An example of an ISO9001 compliant transaction
A>
A> 1. The customer enters a restuarant and is given a menu with pictures of the food. (P1)
A> 2. The waiter takes the order and repeats the order back to the customer for confirmation. (P1)
A> 3. The waiter brings the food and doubles check that the order is complete. (P2)
A> 4. The waiter comes back to check if everything is okay. (P2)
A> 5. The cashier checks that all was well when the bill is paid. (P3)
A> 6. The whole transaction is recorded and the receipt gives a website for feedback. (P3)
A> 7. The customer's feedback on the website is analyzed for patterns of service that could be improved. (P4)

X> ## ISO9001 and MacDonalds
X>
X> Worldwide MacDonald is a successful multinational enterprize run by staff most of which are under the age of 21 and yet it is a certified ISO9001 company. When a customer orders food at any MacDonald outlet in the world, the interaction between the customer and the counter staff is the same. Create a swim lane workflow diagram to describe the information flow in the conversation between the customer, the counter staff, the kitchen staff, the accounting system and the point of sale computer system. Discuss how this illustrates the basic principles of ISO9001 principles for quality management.

Since ISO 9000 was first published in 1987, it has been follow by a long list of international standards that define and specify how various aspects of business, hardware and software are to be implemented. Each new standard builds on the principles already established in other standards. These developments lead Jim Whitehurst to realize that "the best practices in creating open source software also translate well into managing an entire company." By embracing open source values, he showed how leaders can successfully create "a rebooted, redesigned, reinvented organization suitable for the decentralized, empowered, digital age."[^whitehurst]

[^whitehurst]: Jim Whitehurst, 2015. The Open Organization: Igniting Passion and Performance. Harvard Business Review. Available online at https://opensource.com/open-organization/

As organizations embrace the concept of open organizations they recognize that openness as a necessary orientation toward success and pursing openness in organizations can lead to 3 possessive outcomes:[^ambassador]
 
[^ambassador]: The Open Organization Ambassadors, 2017. The Open Organization Definition. 2nd Edition. Available online at https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/gated-content/openorg_definition_ebook.pdf
 
* **Greater agility:** resulting from the synergy that arises when members share a common vision and work together toward common goals.

* **Faster innovation:** because ideas from both inside and outside the organization receive more equitable consideration and rapid experimentation

* **Increased engagement:** as members clearly see connections between their particular activities and an organization's overarching values, mission, and spirit.

![Core elements of open organizations](images/openorg.png)

Although every open organization is unique, there is a common core of elements that characterize an open organization. Each core element is composed of a different dataset of information to be gathered and distributed so to allow these elements to be combined in powerful and productive ways.

* **Transparency:** Workers have access to all pertinent information and willingly disclose and discuss their work. People affected by decisions can access and review the processes and arguments that lead to the decision and are free to comment and respond to them. Successes and failures are both valued for the lessons they provide.
* **Inclusivity:** Protocols and procedures are in place to encourage constructive inclusion of diverse perspectives. Leaders are conscious of voices not present in dialog and actively seek to include them. People work transparently and use technical standards to ensure and encourage access to discussion forums.
* **Adaptability:** Feedback mechanisms provide access for suggestions from members of the organizations and outside members.
* **Collaboration:** People ascribe to the principle that working together produces better results from the very beginning of the project. Products of development are made available to other projects to use creatively.
* **Community:** Shared values and principles that guide decision making are clear and obvious to members of the organization. All levels of workers are encouraged and empowered to make meaningful contributions to collaborative work. Leaders mentor others and demonstrate strong accountability to the organizations by modelling shared values and principles.

IT Strategy provides a road map of where IT developments and operations are going. This is derived from an understanding of the nature of the business and is not restricted by current realities. The IT strategy is as much a definition of what IT intends to do as well as what it will not do. Above all, an effective IT Business strategy does not conform to a vendor's product road map. However, successful strategies must recognize the IT Operating Model that the business gives to IT.[^ross]

# Changing nature of business

## Emerging role of brick and mortar shops

It is clear that the retail companies in rapid growth are those who are able to upgrade the services of the tranditional storefront into a more convenient, efficient and user-friendly setting that compliments the services available online. Banks have moved their services online and to ATM to increase the convenience of handling money while lowering operating costs. Online companies like Amazon have teamed up with traditional shopping chains like Target to allows customers the opportunity to compare, touch and feel products before purchasing them either in the shop or online. Online orders can be delivered to shops to reduce shipping costs. Amazon has even integrated such high tech features as AI, face recognition and sensor to change the user shopping experience.[^amazon] Technology play a critical role in all of these developments.

2. Social media ads based on shared views and ideas
3. Personal profiling to drive the user experience at a website based on specific interests and preferences expressed

#### Impact of Social Media on Brand and Product Marketing

1. Word of mouth referrals from trusted acquaintance are powerful endorsements and attractions.
2. Customer testimonials are often decisive in purchasing decisions.
3. Community discussion of a product underdevelopment increases trust 
4. False testimonies are a problem: fakes entries will attempt to over sell a product and grumbling customers will attempt to destroy a company
