# Essentials of Business

Business is a network of transactions attempt provide fair compensation for goods or services rendered in the most effective and efficient manner.

> Business is a sustainable set of interactions between individuals in which goods and services are provided and the provider is compensated. 
 
Individual businesses are always centered around a core set of goods and services as a commodity that creates value. The key to business success is to minimize material, production, and distribution costs while increasing the value of the commodity to the customers. This is achieved through a network of contracts and business transactions with suppliers and distributors.

ISO 9000 was first published in 1987 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was designed as a family of quality management systems standards to help organizations manage the meeting of the needs of customers and while meeting statutory and regulatory requirements related to a product or service.[^iso]  The standards provide guidance and tools for companies and organizations who want to ensure that their products and services consistently meet customer’s requirements, and that quality is consistently improved.

[^iso]: International Organization for Standardization, 2015. ISO 9001:2015(en) Quality management systems. Available online at  https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:9001

* **Point 1: Clear customer understanding** of the goods or services offered
* **Point 2: Verification of intended results** 
* **Point 3: Prevention undesired effects**
* **Point 4: Improve performance** based on the information gathered

A> ## An example of an ISO9001 compliant transaction
A>
A> 1. The customer enters a restuarant and is given a menu with pictures of the food. (P1)
A> 2. The waiter takes the order and repeats the order back to the customer for confirmation. (P1)
A> 3. The waiter brings the food and doubles check that the order is complete. (P2)
A> 4. The waiter comes back to check if everything is okay. (P2)
A> 5. The cashier checks that all was well when the bill is paid. (P3)
A> 6. The whole transaction is recorded and the receipt gives a website for feedback. (P3)
A> 7. The customer's feedback on the website is analyzed for patterns of service that could be improved. (P4)

X> ## ISO9001 and MacDonalds
X>
X> Worldwide MacDonald is a successful multinational enterprize run by staff most of which are under the age of 21 and yet it is a certified ISO9001 company. When a customer orders food at any MacDonald outlet in the world, the interaction between the customer and the counter staff is the same. Create a swim lane workflow diagram to describe the information flow in the conversation between the customer, the counter staff, the kitchen staff, the accounting system and the point of sale computer system. Discuss how this illustrates the basic principles of ISO9001 principles for quality management.

IT Strategy provides a road map of where IT developments and operations are going. This is derived from an understanding of the nature of the business and is not restricted by current realities. The IT strategy is as much a definition of what IT intends to do as well as what it will not do. Above all, an effective IT Business strategy does not conform to a vendor's product road map. However, successful strategies must recognize the IT Operating Model that the business gives to IT.[^ross]
