## Essentials of Business

Business is a sustainable set of interactions in which goods and services are provided and the supplier is compensated. The corresponding network of processes and transactions attempt to provide fair compensation for goods and services rendered in the most effective and efficient manner.

X> ### Nature of Business
X>
X>  Discuss how the following premises would impact the nature, success, and longevity of the businesses.
X>
X> 1. Business is all about making lots and lots of money quickly by any means possible.
X> 2. Business provides fair compensation for goods or services. 
X> 3. Business is the process of copying the industry leaders and providing nearly the same goods and services at a fraction of the cost.
X> 4. Business provides special opportunities for myself, my friends and relatives at the expense of our customers.


Individual businesses are always centered around a core set of goods and services which address the specific needs of clients creating a sense of value and desire. Good design and pre-market testing help to define the nature of the products and services. At the same time, controlling production and distribution costs make it possible to deliver goods and services at a suitable price point for customers. A network of contracts and business transactions with suppliers and distributors ensures that products and services are delivered on time and on budget.

Advances in technology have changed the nature of markets. The internet and social media have exposed individuals to a wider range of possibilities. This creates new desires and expectations in customers. As a result, today's businesses are as diverse as the customers and markets they support. Many businesses support both mass distribution to millions of consumers while catering to the diverse needs of individual customers that number in the millions. At the same time, markets are rapidly changing, particularly as youth explore new careers, lifestyles, technologies, and life goals.[SNYCYC 2019]{#SNYCYC2019}, [Tan 2019]{#Tan2019}

### Software to facilitate business interactions

As a business grows, so does the complexity of the interactions between its departments. There is a complex web of interactions within a modern business organization. Management focuses on the control, operation, and development of a business. Financiers use investments to maximize opportunities to grow the business.  Production engineers tune the processes needed to deliver products, But the key concern for IT is the nature and volume of information to be analyzed, shared and communicated in a timely fashion,
as shown in the following diagram:

![Interactions between business departments](images/businessdepts.png)

## Essentials of Business Quality Management: (ISO9001)

Businesses are driven by an active communication chain that drives the business process. The effectiveness of teamwork and management depends on effective communication. However, the communication chain can be interrupted by bottlenecks in the flow of data, inconsistent or misleading reporting, and other communication breakdowns. Quality standards help ensure that processes related to production and quality control are subject to timely, data-driven management. 
  
A> ### Communication Chain
A>
A> ![Communication Chain](images/communication.png)
A>
A> | Initiation message | Response message |
A> |-----------|-----------|
A> | Greeting | Acknowledgement |
A> | Question | Response |
A> | Proposal | Acceptance/Rejection |
A> | Command | Action |
A> | Accusation | Acceptance/Rebuttal |

ISO 9000 was first published in 1987 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The derivative quality standards help organizations address the needs of customers and while meeting relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.[ISO,2019]{#ISOweb}  The standards provide guidance and tools for companies and organizations who want to ensure that their processes regularly deliver products and services that meet customerâ€™s requirements. These standards are reviewed and revised every 5 years.

* **Point 1: Clear customer understanding** of the goods or services offered
* **Point 2: Verification of intended results** 
* **Point 3: Prevention undesired effects**
* **Point 4: Improve performance** based on the information gathered

A> ### An example of an ISO9001 compliant transaction
A>
A> 1. The customer enters a restaurant and is given a menu with pictures of the food. (P1)
A> 2. The waiter takes the order and repeats the order back to the customer for confirmation. (P1)
A> 3. The waiter brings the food and doubles check that the order is complete. (P2)
A> 4. The waiter comes back to check if everything is okay. (P2)
A> 5. The cashier checks that all was well when the bill is paid. (P3)
A> 6. The whole transaction is recorded and the receipt gives a website for feedback. (P3)
A> 7. The customer's feedback on the website is analyzed for patterns of service that could be improved. (P4)

X> ### ISO9001 and MacDonalds
X>
X> Worldwide MacDonald is a successful multinational enterprise run by staff most of which are under the age of 21 and yet it is a certified ISO9001 company. When a customer orders food at any MacDonald outlet in the world, the interaction between the customer and the counter staff is the same. Create a swim lane workflow diagram to describe the information flow in the conversation between the customer, the counter staff, the kitchen staff, the accounting system, and the point-of-sale computer system. Discuss how this illustrates the basic principles of ISO9001 principles for quality management.

Since ISO 9000 was first published in 1987, it has been revised and replaced by a long list of international standards that define and specify how various aspects of business, hardware, and software are to be implemented. Each new standard builds on the principles already established and addresses the weaknesses of previous standards.[ISO, 2015]{#ISO9001} These developments lead Jim Whitehurst to realize that "the best practices in creating open source software also translate well into managing an entire company." By embracing open source values, he showed how leaders can successfully create "a rebooted, redesigned, reinvented organization suitable for the decentralized, empowered, digital age."[Whitehurst 2015]{#Whitehurst2015}


As organizations embrace the concept of open organizations,  they discover that openness necessary for success and attempts to pursue openness lead to 3 possible outcomes:[OOA 2017]{#OOA2017}
  
* **Greater agility:** resulting from the synergy that arises when members share a common vision and work together toward common goals.

* **Faster innovation:** because ideas from both inside and outside the organization receive more equitable consideration and rapid experimentation

* **Increased engagement:** as members clearly see connections between their particular activities and an organization's overarching values, mission, and spirit.

![Core elements of open organizations](images/openorg.png)

Although every open organization is unique, there is a common core of elements that characterize open organizations. Each core element is composed of a different dataset to be gathered, distributed, and combined in powerful and productive ways.

* **Transparency:** Workers have access to all pertinent information and willingly disclose and discuss their work. Workers can access and review the processes and arguments that lead to decisions and are free to comment and respond to them. Successes and failures are valued for the lessons they provide.
* **Inclusivity:** Protocols and procedures are developed to encourage constructive discussion from diverse perspectives. Leaders actively seek to include voices not present in the dialog. Technology is used to ensure and encourage access to discussion forums.
* **Adaptability:** Feedback mechanisms provide access for suggestions from members of the organizations and outside members.
* **Collaboration:** The organization adheres to the principle that working together produces better results. Products of development are made available to other projects to use creatively.
* **Community:** Shared values and principles that guide decision making are clear and obvious to members of the organization. All workers are encouraged and empowered to make meaningful contributions to the collaborative effort. Leaders mentor others and model shared values and principles.


## Understanding the role of IT in business

As IT Departments become more receptive to business strategy and play a transformative role in the nature of the business, Enterprise Architecture will emerge according to the following evolutionary steps.[Hohpe 2017a]{#Hohpe2017A}, [Hohpe 2017b]{#Hohpe2017B}

A>### The Establishment of an IT Department

## Business views of the role of IT

{title="Different business views of IT"}
| FOCUS: | COST | RETURN ON INVESTMENT | BUSINESS VALUE | SPEED AND INNOVATION |
|----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|

|CIO Reports to: | CFO | COO | CDO | CEO |
|Common stragegy: | Outsource IT | Harmonize/Rationalize | Insource IT | IT = business |
|Levers: | Cost cutting | Economies of scale | Economies of Efficiency | Economies of Speed |

IT Strategy provides a road map of where IT developments and operations are going. This is derived from an understanding of the nature of the business and is not restricted by current realities. The IT strategy is as much a definition of what IT intends to do as well as what it will not do. Above all, an effective IT Business strategy does not conform to a vendor's product road map. However, successful strategies must recognize the IT Operating Model that the business gives to IT.[Ross et al 2006]{#Ross2006}

## Changing nature of business

It is clear that the retail companies in rapid growth are those who are able to upgrade the services of the traditional storefront into a more convenient, efficient and user-friendly setting that compliments the services available online. Banks have moved their services online and to ATM to increase the convenience of handling money while lowering operating costs. Online companies like Amazon have teamed up with traditional shopping chains like Target to allows customers the opportunity to compare, touch and feel products before purchasing them either in the shop or online. Online orders can be delivered to shops to reduce shipping costs. Amazon has even integrated such high tech features as AI, face recognition and sensor to change the user shopping experience.[Amazon, 2016]{#Amazon2016} Technology play a critical role in all of these developments.

### Approaches to marketing online

1. Search engine ads based on topics being searched
2. Social media ads based on shared views and ideas
3. Personal profiling to drive the user experience at a website based on specific interests and preferences expressed

#### Impact of Social Media on Brand and Product Marketing

1. Word-of-mouth referrals from trusted acquaintances are powerful endorsements and attractions.
2. Customer testimonials are often decisive in purchasing decisions.
3. Community discussion of the products being developed increases trust in the company.
4. False testimonies are a problem: fakes entries attempt to oversell a product or provide complaints in an attempt to destroy the company.
