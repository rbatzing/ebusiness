# Business Process Model (BPM)

There are many good reasons for using BPMN.[^camunda]

[^camunda]: Camunda, 2018. BPMN Tutorial. Available online at https://camunda.com/bpmn/

* **Recognized Standard:** BPMN is owned by an institution and is supported by many software products. Third party BPMN editors are available in the form of desktop apps like yEd[^yed] or online services like Camunda.[^camunda2]

* **Simplicity:** BPMN is based on a system of graphic symbols that easy to learn.

* **Power of expression:** BPMN reduces descriptions of complex process work flows to a graphic model that is easy to grasp.

* **Implementation in IT:** BPMN was developed to support technical implementation of processes ("Process Automation"). The more important IT becomes in a company, the more helpful BPMN can be, especially when process changes can be accomplished by a simple change of line.

A> ## A simple example
A>
A> The idea of a BPMN model is to model a process from the beginning to the end.

A> ![A simple process](images/simpleBPMN.png)

Naming conventions help to improve the readability of the process:

* **Tasks:** described as a [verb] + [object]: ``Acquire groceries`` is better than *first take care of shopping for groceries*

* **Events:** should be described as something that has already happened ``hunger noticed`` is better *when I begin to feel hungry*

## Notation

## BPMN Model Simulation

BP Model sumulators allow process designers to test their model. The general approach is to use a task generator that creates and processes tasks at rates equal to the measured performance in the work place. Data is collected to measure the rate of utilization and work flow at all stages of the model in order to identify issues like bottlenecks and irregularities in the work loads of individual employees. Simulation test are usually conducted in 3 phases: 

| Stage | Description | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Modeling | Simple visual model of the business process | Specify the individual roles and the business logic of the process |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Simulation | Run task generation and execution according to measured performance | Test the model based on work place rates of service |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Analysis | Creates a dashboard of performance indicators | Verifies process design; Identifies opportunities for process improvement; Helps to maximize employee utilization; Provides for performance-based estimates of cost |
|-------|-------------|---------|

Online services such as http://www.bpsimulator.com provide a useful means for testing a process design through the display of the model, test results dashboard and performance indicators for each stage of the process. The design is actually a translation of a BPMN model into a Event-driven Process Chain (EPC). However, additional key details are required to quantify the capacity and number of resources available. These details are saved in the attributes for each node as shown in the next section.[

|---------|------------------|-----------------------|
|Rule distribution of tasks from suppliers | AND/XOR | Logical rule for processing of tasks, received from its predecessors function. If the value is XOR function will be assigned to the execution of tasks on delivery from any predecessor on model. If the value is AND function will not be executed until by a links of all predecessors functions do not will come the same task. Example: ![AND/XOR (suppliers)](images/exmodeling3.png) |
|---------|------------------|-----------------------|
|Rule distribution of tasks to consumer | AND/XOR | Logical rule for distribution of completed tasks to consumers of the function. If the value is AND a completed tasks will be distributed to all customer's functions. If the value is XOR task will be distributed to the consumer with a certain Probability distribution of tasks to consumer. Example: ![AND/XOR (consumer)](images/exmodeling4.png)|
|---------|------------------|-----------------------|
|Probability distribution of tasks to consumer | Number | Percentage that determines the probability distribution of tasks to a consumer of the function. The sum of all percent probability distribution of the output of one function must be equal to 100% with value of Rule distribution of tasks to consumer is XOR.|
|---------|------------------|-----------------------|
|Time of delivery a task to consumer | Range | Minimum and maximum value of the time required for transporting completed tasks to the next consumer of the function. For example transfer time from the back-office signed copies of the contract to the customer is from 12 to 24 hours.|
|---------|------------------|-----------------------|
|Cost of the resource per task | Currency unit | In case of set up determines the costs of resource use to perform a single task, regardless of the time spent. For example the delivery of goods by courier to the city costs 200 currency unit.|
|---------|------------------|-----------------------|
|Number of employees | Number | The actual number of staff positions in the organizational structure or appointed as an executive of the functions. For example, 5 employees of call center to answer the incoming calls.|
|---------|------------------|-----------------------|
|Cost of using of the resource | Currency unit | Pay rate hours of operation of the resource. For example, the make-up artist working hour is worth 1000, and lease of cloud storage just 0.0001 of currency unit.|
|---------|------------------|-----------------------|
|Operating periods | Range | The time period available resources to perform the functions. For example, to account for the availability of dinner break necessary two periods: 09:00-13:00 and 14:00-18:00.|
|---------|------------------|-----------------------|
|Tasks count | Number | The number of tasks formed by the generator at a certain period of work. For example, to simulate the arrival rate of new tasks 1 times per minute necessary to set the frequency to 60 tasks per hour.|
|---------|------------------|-----------------------|

### Linking objects together

All objects in the model should be at least one link to another object. To create a link between objects, you must first double-click on the object - the source of links, and then click on the object - the recipient, link will be created with an arrow on the side of the second object. Link means a direct impact or relationship of one object from another. Not all objects can be linked to each other. The group of objects: Tasks Generator, Function, Events, Procedure and Check Point can be suppliers (predecessors) or consumers (followers) of each other. Other objects only as the impact on function, as shown below the diagram:

![Linking of Objects](images/exmodeling5.png)

* An "X" and "+" at the beginning or end of the link means allocation rules "XOR" or "AND" accordingly. The numbers at the beginning of the arrows correspond to the value of the Probability distribution of tasks to consumer.
 
* All manipulations with the objects of the model are reversible and can be reversed by a visual component at the bottom of the screen or pressing Ctrl+Z on the keyboard.

With this extra data it is possible to simulate a day at work. The statistics collected help to pinpoint bottlenecks and limiting resources. The system provides a dashboard to summarize the results.
 
![Dashboard of Test Results](images/bpsim2.png)

The model uses generators to simulate the volume of the demand for needs. Data comes from the functions and key check points of the model that monitor the workflow that passes these nodes. The executor nodes determine the capacity of the system. Performance is varied by changing the number of individuals in the role of executors.
