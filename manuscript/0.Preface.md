# Preface

Advances and developments in Computer Science (CS) are driven by the need to create applications that effectively answer real world problems. The key to good software engineering is developing a deep understanding of the problem domain from the users perspective. The most significant advancements have emerged as result of breakthoughs in understanding the nature of the corresponding problem domains. As end users are integrated into software development and testing teams, the resulting products are more intuitive and successful in delivering services.  

In CS, most of our graduates will go on to develop applications and solutions for clients who did not study CS but are experts in some other problem domain. Courses that help students to explore and understand the basic issues in other problem domains are at the heart of liberal arts education and provide excellent preparation for a career in software development. 

As a part of the effort to introduce CS students to e-Business from a Business perspective, we offer a course had the following course description and is taught in Thai using English based resources.

> {thaifont} **CS340 ธุรกิจอิเล็กทรอนิกส์:** หลักการการดำเนินธุรกิจโดยใช้สื่ออิเล็กทรอนิกส์ การวางแผนทรัพยากรขององค์กร การบริหารความสัมพันธ์ลูกค้า และการสื่อสารผ่านโซเชียลมีเดียทั้งภายในและภายนอกองค์กร

> {latinfont} **CS340 E-BUSINESS.** Principles of business operations using information technology. This includes a discussion of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and the use of social media to communicate both within and outside the organization.

This book is the product of that course. Its humble beginnings was a collection of class slides, notes and exercises which continues to evolve in response to changes in the software industry and convervations with business leaders. The basic design of the course is as follows:

> **Unit 1: General principles.**  A discussion of the key principles that define and characterize business both in the real world and in cyberspace.

> **Unit 2: Business modelling.** A discussion of leading methods used to create software models of the key transactions and activities that take place in business in general and in e-busiess in particular.

> **Unit 3: e-Business systems.** A survey of the concepts and functions of key open-source, online business systems. Each system is studied to determine how solutions are provided by addressing mission critical questions using available data resources.

> **Unit 4: Emerging Technologies.** A discussion of futuristic e-Business technologies and practices that have already had an impact on how business is conducted world-wide.
