# Preface

Advances and developments in Computer Science (CS) are driven by the need to create more effective applications to answer real world problems. The most significant advancements have emerged as a result of breakthough in understand the nature of the problem domain. Making end users part of software development teams has been a standard principle in software engineer. As a CS instructor, it is important to recognize and the fact that our CS graduates will go on to develop applications and solutions for clients who did not major in CS. In keeping with the principles of literal arts education, I feel the best way I can prepare my students for their professional careers is by helping them explore and understand the basic issues of their chosen problem domain. 

To this end, our department has launched a course to introduce CS students to e-Business. The course had the following course description and was taught in Thai using English based resources.

-> CS340	E-BUSINESS. Principles of business operations using information technology. This includes a discussion of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and the use of social media to communicate both within and outside the organization.
