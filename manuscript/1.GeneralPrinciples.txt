A> ## An example of an ISO9001 compliant transaction
A>
A> 1. The customer enters a restuarant and is given a menu with pictures of the food. (P1)
A> 2. The waiter takes the order and repeats the order back to the customer for confirmation. (P1)
A> 3. The waiter brings the food and doubles check that the order is complete. (P2)
A> 4. The waiter comes back to check if everything is okay. (P2)
A> 5. The cashier checks that all was well when the bill is paid. (P3)
A> 6. The whole transaction is recorded and the receipt gives a website for feedback. (P3)
A> 7. The customer's feedback on the website is analyzed for patterns of service that could be improved. (P4)

X> ## ISO9001 and MacDonalds
X>
X> Worldwide MacDonald is a successful multinational enterprize run by staff most of which are under the age of 21 and yet it is a certified ISO9001 company. When a customer orders food at any MacDonald outlet in the world, the interaction between the customer and the counter staff is the same. Create a swim lane workflow diagram to describe the information flow in the conversation between the customer, the counter staff, the kitchen staff, the accounting system and the point of sale computer system. Discuss how this illustrates the basic principles of ISO9001 principles for quality management.

### Understanding the role of IT in business

{title="Different business views of IT"}
| | Cost Center | Asset | Partner | Enabler |
|----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Focus: | Cost | Return on investment | Business value | Speed & Innovation |
|CIO Reports to: | CFO | COO | CDO | CEO |
|Common stragegy: | Outsource IT | Harmonize/Rationalize | Insource IT | IT = business |
|Levers: | Cost cutting | Economies of scale | Economies of Efficiency | Economies of Speed |

IT Strategy provides a road map of where IT developments and operations are going. This is derived from an understanding of the nature of the business and is not restricted by current realities. The IT strategy is as much a definition of what IT intends to do as well as what it will not do. Above all, an effective IT Business strategy does not conform to a vendor's product road map. However, successful strategies must recognize the IT Operating Model that the business gives to IT.[*ref3]
