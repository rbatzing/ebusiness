* **Recognized Standard:** BPMN is owned by an institution and is supported by many software products. Third party BPMN editors are available in the form of desktop apps like yEd[^yed] or online services like Camunda.[^camunda2]

* **Simplicity:** BPMN is based on a system of graphic symbols that easy to learn.

* **Power of expression:** BPMN reduces descriptions of complex process work flows to a graphic model that is easy to grasp.

* **Implementation in IT:** BPMN was developed to support technical implementation of processes ("Process Automation"). The more important IT becomes in a company, the more helpful BPMN can be, especially when process changes can be accomplished by a simple change of line.

A> The idea of a BPMN model is to model a process from the beginning to the end.

Naming conventions help to improve the readability of the process:

* **Tasks:** described as a [verb] + [object]: ``Acquire groceries`` is better than *first take care of shopping for groceries*

* **Events:** should be described as something that has already happened ``hunger noticed`` is better *when I begin to feel hungry*
