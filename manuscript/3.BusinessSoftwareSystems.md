However as implied by the following word cloud, fitness of applicants for a job has many dimensions and is hard to measure accurately.

## Belbin Team Roles

Research showed that the most successful teams were made up of a diverse mix of behaviours; they had access to all nine Belbin Team Roles. A Team Role was defined by Dr Meredith Belbin as "A tendency to behave, contribute and interrelate with others in a particular way". The value of Belbin Team Role theory lies in enabling an individual or team to benefit from self knowledge and adjust according to the demands being made by the external situation.

The concept was derived from a study of successful and unsuccessful teams competing in
Business Games at Henley Management College, England. Managers taking part in the exercise
were given a battery of psychometric tests and put into teams of varying composition. As time
progressed different clusters of behaviour were identified as underlying the success of the teams. These successful clusters of behaviour were then given names. Hence the emergence of nine Team Roles shown with the distribution among British managers:[^fisher]

## Myers Briggs Test

The 16 personality types that were developed by Isabel Briggs Myers and Katharine Cook Briggs, which was built on the work of Carl Jung in the early 1900s. Based on the 4 dimensions of Carl Jung's theory of personality types:

| Dimension | Extremes |
|:-------------|:------------|
|Energizes | Extroversion (E) vs Internal (I)|
|Perceives information | Sensing (S) vs Intuitive (N)|
|Decision making| Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F)|
|World view | Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P)|
 
Myers Briggs Test has been administered to a large number of people helping to validate the value of this instrument for a number of applications. Generally successful workers tend to gravitate to specific careers based on their personality profile as shown in the next sections.[^tieger]

* The supervisor analyses the factors behind work performances of employees.
* The employers are in position to guide the employees for a better performance.

### Objectives of Performance Appraisal

Performance Appraisal is done with following objectives in mind:

* To maintain records in order to determine compensation packages, wage structure, salaries raises, etc.
* To identify the strengths and weaknesses of employees to place right men on right job.
* To maintain and assess the potential present in a person for further growth and development.
* To provide a feedback to employees regarding their performance and related status.
* To provide a feedback to employees regarding their performance and related status.

* To review and retain the promotional and other training programmes.

### Advantages of Performance Appraisal

1. **Promotion:** Performance Appraisal helps the supervisors to chalk out the promotion programmes for efficient employees. In this regards, inefficient workers can be dismissed or demoted in case.
2. **Compensation:** Performance Appraisal helps in chalking out compensation packages for employees. Merit rating is possible through performance appraisal. Performance Appraisal tries to give worth to a performance. Compensation packages which includes bonus, high salary rates, extra benefits, allowances and pre-requisites are dependent on performance appraisal. The criteria should be merit rather than seniority.
3. **Employees Development:** The systematic procedure of performance appraisal helps the supervisors to frame training policies and programmes. It helps to analyse strengths and weaknesses of employees so that new jobs can be designed for efficient employees. It also helps in framing future development programmes.
4. **Selection Validation:** Performance Appraisal helps the supervisors to understand the validity and importance of the selection procedure. The supervisors come to know the validity and thereby the strengths and weaknesses of selection procedure. Future changes in selection methods can be made in this regard.
5. **Communication:** For an organization, effective communication between employees and employers is very important. Through performance appraisal, communication can be sought for in the following ways:

    * Through performance appraisal, the employers can understand and accept skills of subordinates.
    * The subordinates can also understand and create a trust and confidence in superiors.
    * It also helps in maintaining cordial and congenial labour management relationship.
    * It develops the spirit of work and boosts the morale of employees.
	
> All the above factors ensure effective communication.
