<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Essentials of Business</h2>
<p>Business is a set of interactions in which goods and services are provided and compensation is rendered. Businesses become sustainable when the compensation rendered meets the short-term and long-term requirements of the business. Most business fail because of an inability to develop a network of processes and transactions to address a market demand that meets or exceeds their expenses. Ideally, a start-up should aim to seek fair compensation for goods and services rendered in the most effective and efficient manner.</p>

<p>Individual businesses are always centered around a core set of goods and services which address the specific needs of clients creating a sense of value and desire. Good design and pre-market testing help to define the nature of the products and services. At the same time, controlling production and distribution costs make it possible to deliver goods and services at a suitable price point for customers. Careful supply chain and operations management develops a network of contracts and business transactions with suppliers and distributors ensures that products and services are delivered on time and on budget.</p>

<p>Among IT Managers, there appears to be 2 major approaches to understanding the nature of business and IT’s function: using IT to redesign the business or engineering the current organization. The political implications of the approach chosen can be immense and often the success of an IT manager will depend on the level of support from those that manage the IT department manager.</p>

<p>IT Strategy provides a road map of where IT developments and operations are going. This is derived from an understanding of the nature of the business and is not restricted by current realities. The IT strategy is as much a definition of what IT intends to do as well as what it will not do. Above all, an effective IT Business strategy does not conform to a vendor’s product road map. However, successful strategies must recognize the IT Operating Model that the business gives to IT. <span class="citation">(Ross, Weill, and Robertson <a href="#ref-Ross2006">2006</a>)</span></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Software to facilitate business interactions</h3>
<p>As a business grows, so does the complexity of the interactions between its departments. There is a complex web of interactions within a modern business organization. Management focuses on the control, operation, and development of a business. Financiers use investments to maximize opportunities to grow the business. Production engineers tune the processes needed to deliver products, But the key concern for IT is the nature and volume of information to be analyzed, shared and communicated in a timely fashion,

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Essentials of Business Quality Management</h2>
<p>Businesses are driven by an active communication chain that drives the business process. The effectiveness of teamwork and management depends on effective communication. However, the communication chain can be interrupted by bottlenecks in the flow of data, inconsistent or misleading reporting, and other communication breakdowns. Quality standards help ensure that processes related to production and quality control are subject to timely, data-driven management. In essence the ability of a business to fix a problem depends on the quality of communications that provide access to the description of the true nature and extend of the problem and knowledge of possible remedies.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/communication.png" alt="Communication Chain" />
<p class="caption">Communication Chain</p>
</div>
<p>Meaningful communication requires a reciprocal interaction between the speaker and the listener. As shown in the following table, social norms and good ethicate depend on transmission of a message and an appropriate response. The communication chain is lost when messages in either direction are lost or misinterpreted. The growing use of social media with its emphasis on icons or one word responses has often been blamed for the reduction in quality of personal verbal and written skills. Interaction with customers and suppliers depends on clear and effective communication.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Changes to Business</h2>
<p>Businesses today have unprecedented opportunities to rapidly address issues that arise. Such advances in such fields as deep machine learning, Big Data analytics, Internet of Things, collective intelligence, online payment and social media are creating a reality that was only hinted at by the 1999 book <strong><em>Business at the speed of thought.</em></strong> <span class="citation">(Gates <a href="#ref-Gates1999">1999</a>)</span> Businesses that were market leaders in the past, but failed to keep pace with the changes, suddenly find themselves bankrupt and replaced by new competitors. In 500BC, Heraclitus of Ephesus once penned the warning that “Change is the only constant in life” but he words ring true as an accurate description of today’s business environment.</p>
<div id="open-organization" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Open Organization</h3>
<p>Since ISO9000 was first published in 1987, it has been revised and replaced by a long list of international standards that define and specify how various aspects of business, hardware, and software are to be implemented. Each new standard built on the principles already established and addresses the weaknesses of previous standards. <span class="citation">(International Organization for Standardization <a href="#ref-ISO2015">2015</a>)</span> While these developments help to ensure consistent service and quality, something else was needed to empower staff to collectively think and implement creative solutions to challenges. Jim Whitehurst at RedHat.com invested considerable effort to address this problem. He started with the realization that “the best practices in creating open source software also translate well into managing an entire company.” By embracing open source values and creating a new open standard for communities, he showed how leaders can successfully create “a rebooted, redesigned, reinvented organization suitable for the decentralized, empowered, digital age.”<span class="citation">(Whitehurst <a href="#ref-Whitehurst2015">2015</a>)</span> In creating the open organization, he and his colleagues have documented a shift that is changing in the way businesses are organized, managed and run.</p>

<p>Successful, innovative organizations demonstrate the following core principles which form the basis for the core elements of open organizations. <span class="citation">(Whitehurst <a href="#ref-Whitehurst2019">2019</a>)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The best ideas come from anywhere.</li>
<li>The best ideas should always win.</li>
<li>Contribution matters more than title.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/openorg.png" alt="Core elements of open organizations" />
<p class="caption">Core elements of open organizations</p>
</div>
<p>Although every open organization is unique, there is a common core of elements that characterize open organizations. Each core element is composed of a different dataset to be gathered, distributed, and combined in powerful and productive ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Workers have access to all pertinent information and willingly disclose and discuss their work. Workers can access and review the processes and arguments that lead to decisions and are free to comment and respond to them. Successes and failures are valued for the lessons they provide.</li>
<li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Protocols and procedures are developed to encourage constructive discussion from diverse perspectives. Leaders actively seek to include voices not present in the dialog. Technology is used to ensure and encourage access to discussion forums.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Feedback mechanisms provide access for suggestions from members of the organizations and outside members.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> The organization adheres to the principle that working together produces better results. Products of development are made available to other projects to use creatively.</li>
<li><strong>Community:</strong> Shared values and principles that guide decision making are clear and obvious to members of the organization. All workers are encouraged and empowered to make meaningful contributions to the collaborative effort. Leaders mentor others and model shared values and principles.</li>
</ul>
<p>As organizations embrace the core concepts of open organizations, they discover that openness is necessary for success and that attempts to pursue openness will lead to 3 possible outcomes: <span class="citation">(The Open Organization Ambassadors <a href="#ref-OOA2017">2017</a>)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Greater agility:</strong> resulting from the synergy that arises when members share a common vision and work together toward common goals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Faster innovation:</strong> because ideas from both inside and outside the organization receive more equitable consideration and rapid experimentation</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increased engagement:</strong> as members clearly see connections between their particular activities and an organization’s overarching values, mission, and spirit.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="working-as-a-developer-within-an-open-organization" class="unnumbered">Working as a developer within an open organization</h2>
<p>Increasingly large IT development center like Google, Oracle and Apple are becoming open organizations to encourage and value innovation. Each worker in those companies is expected to do his/her part in contributing to the development effort. However, young IT staff have a very high rate of turn over as they are often foreign to working in environments that productively focus creativity to solve issues. This mismatch was the inspiration behind a recent blog concerning the five laws that development engineers should know. <span class="citation">(Short <a href="#ref-Short2017">2017</a>)</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Forget the phrase ‘I do not know’:</strong> Treat every task as an opportunity to learn and dedicate the time needed to become an expert</li>
<li><strong>Read the manual! :</strong> Documentation was written for a purpose. Do not waste colleague’s time.</li>
<li><strong>Search before asking:</strong> Do not contribute to the problems but contribute to the solution.</li>
<li><strong>Anything is possible:</strong> Anything is possible in this space with proper time, coordination, and effort. Trust by verifying new ideas</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledge technical debt:</strong> Technical debt is the result of decisions that made sense at the time someone made them but cause problems because they are not based on reality.</li>

Banks have moved their services online and to ATM to increase the convenience of handling money while lowering operating costs. Online companies like Amazon have teamed up with traditional shopping chains like Target to allows customers the opportunity to compare, touch and feel products before purchasing them either in the shop or online.
