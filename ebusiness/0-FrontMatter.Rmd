The cover is a photograph of the Financial District from the Marina Bay in Singapore. The amazing metamorphsis of this central business district from swamp land into a thriving financial center of the Region is representative of the current sea-changes in business driven by technological and social developments. Similarly, today's developers of business systems are sowing seeds that will change the future, much like Sir Raffles' vision for a seaport has grown into today's Singapore. 

While early drafts of this book were written in Leanpub Flavored Markdown, this book was developed in RStudio using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@Xie2015]. It was edited in RStudio and later compiled and published online simultaneously as an HTML website, a printable document in PDF and electronic book EPUB format with only 3 clicks of the mouse.
