# Preface {-}

Advances and developments in Computer Science (CS) are driven by the need to create applications that effectively address real-world problems. Successful software development starts with a deep understanding of the problem domain from the users perspective and developing an application that is intuitive and easy to use.  Breakthroughs in understanding the nature of a problem domain create new opportunities for addressing the needs of computer users.  It is now common practice to integrate end users into software development and testing teams, as the resulting products tend to be more intuitive and successful.  

In CS, our graduates will go on to develop applications and solutions for clients who, for the most part, have not studied CS, but who are experts in other problem domains. Courses that help students to explore and understand the basic issues in other problem domains are at the heart of our liberal arts education which balances professional skills with general knowledge needed to function effectively in the market place.
As a part of this effort to introduce CS students to e-Business from a Business/IT perspective, we offer a course with the following course description. It is taught in Thai using English-based resources.

> **CS340 \taibf ธุรกิจอิเล็กทรอนิกส์:**  \tai หลักการการดำเนินธุรกิจโดยใช้สื่ออิเล็กทรอนิกส์ การวางแผนทรัพยากรขององค์กร การบริหารความสัมพันธ์ลูกค้า และการสื่อสารผ่านโซเชียลมีเดียทั้งภายในและภายนอกองค์กร

> **CS340 E-BUSINESS:** Principles of business operations using information technology. This includes a discussion of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and the use of social media to communicate both within and outside the organization.

This book is the product of that course and started as a collection of class slides, notes, and exercises. The content of this book continues to evolve in response to student feedback as well as changes in the software industry and conversations with business leaders and software developers. The basic design of this book is meant to parallel the outline of the corresponding course, as given below:

> **Chapter 1: General principles.**  A discussion of the key principles that define and characterize business both in the real world and in cyberspace.

> **Chapter 2: Business modeling.** A discussion of leading methods used to create software models of the key transactions and activities that take place in business in general and in e-business in particular.

> **Chapter 3: e-Business systems.** A survey of the concepts and functions of key open-source, online business systems. Each system is studied to determine how solutions are provided by addressing mission-critical questions using available data resources.

> **Chapter 4: Emerging Technologies.** A discussion of futuristic e-Business technologies and practices that have already had an impact on how business is conducted worldwide.
