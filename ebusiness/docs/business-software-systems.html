<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Online Store</h2>
<p>An online store attempts to match or exceed the level of customer support provided in brick and mortar stores. However, the personal distance and anonymity of the internet makes this goal harder to achieve. However, online stores like Amazon, Lazada and Alibaba owe their success to their ability to create trust among their community of buyers and sellers. These companies act as arbitrators between customers and vendors, reducing the risk of doing business between unkonwn parties. B ecause trust is so essential to business transactions, many internet shops began as product listings on one of these large marketing sysems, or as a online service to the customers of their brick and mortar chains.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Stages in Customer Purchasing Decisions</h3>
<p>Marketers have long studied the process and requirements of customers before, during and after making a purchase. In a market place that abound in choices, customers must choose between the multiple alternatives. Shopping whether in the physical world or online is at best weak attempt at making a rational decision between the choices, because complete analysis needed to identify the true optimal decision is increditably complex. <span class="citation">(Simon <a href="#ref-Simon1955">1955</a>)</span> However, the urgency of the need drives the buyer to settle for an apparent good choice. However, the internet changes this by providing more information on which to base a rational decision. <span class="citation">(Dewey <a href="#ref-Dewey1910">1910</a>)</span> observed 5 stages in a purchasing decision. A sixth stage has been added here to cover the financial transaction constraints imposed by online monetary systems.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1.1</span> Belbin Team Roles</h4>
<p>Research showed that the most successful teams were made up of a diverse mix of behaviours; they had access to all nine Belbin Team Roles. A Team Role was defined by Dr Meredith Belbin as “A tendency to behave, contribute and interrelate with others in a particular way”. The value of Belbin Team Role theory lies in enabling an individual or team to benefit from self knowledge and adjust according to the demands being made by the external situation. <span class="citation">(Belbin <a href="#ref-Belbin2010">2010</a>)</span> The concept was derived from a study of factors leading to success or failure of teams competing in
Business Games at Henley Management College, England. Managers taking part in the exercise
were given a battery of psychometric tests and put into teams of varying composition. As time
progressed different clusters of behaviour were identified as underlying the success of the teams. These successful clusters of behaviour were then given names. Hence the emergence of nine Team Roles shown with the distribution among British managers: <span class="citation">(Fisher, Hunter, and Macross <a href="#ref-Fisher1998">1998</a>)</span></p>
