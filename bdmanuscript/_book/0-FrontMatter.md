The cover is a photograph of the Financial District from the Marina Bay in Singapore. The amazing metamorphsis of this central business district from swamp land into a regional financial center is representative of the current sea-changes in business driven by technological and social developments. Similarly, today's developers of business systems are sowing seeds that will change the future, much like Sir Raffles' vision for a seaport has grown into today's Singapore. 

While early drafts of this book were written in Leanpub Flavored Markdown, this book was developed in the bookdown dialect of markdown. It was compiled in RStudio and published both as an HTML website and a printable pdf document.
