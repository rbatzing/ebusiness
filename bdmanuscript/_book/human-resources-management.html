<p>Every person is unique and represents a unique set of strengths and weaknesses. At the same time the every job requires different set of characteristics. The role of HR is to attempt to collectin information meant to measure and ascertain how suited an applicant is for a job opening. In theory the goal is to play the right person in the job. However as implied by the following word cloud, fitness of applicants for a job has many dimensions and is hard to measure accurately.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1.1</span> Working in teams</h4>
<p>Research showed that the most successful teams were made up of a diverse mix of behaviours; they had access to all nine Belbin Team Roles. A Team Role was defined by Dr Meredith Belbin as “A tendency to behave, contribute and interrelate with others in a particular way”. The value of Belbin Team Role theory lies in enabling an individual or team to benefit from self knowledge and adjust according to the demands being made by the external situation.</p>
<p>The concept was derived from a study of successful and unsuccessful teams competing in
Business Games at Henley Management College, England. Managers taking part in the exercise
were given a battery of psychometric tests and put into teams of varying composition. As time
progressed different clusters of behaviour were identified as underlying the success of the teams. These successful clusters of behaviour were then given names. Hence the emergence of nine Team Roles shown with the distribution among British managers:<span class="citation">(Fisher, Hunter, and Macross <a href="#ref-Fisher1998">1998</a>)</span></p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that every team requires nine people! Most people will have two or three Team Roles that they are most comfortable with. Team Roles develop and mature. These may change with experience and conscious attention. Different Team Roles may come to the fore in response to the needs of particular situations.</p>
